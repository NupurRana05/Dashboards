Card:-

I designed cards, each with a single and visible numerical value.
Sum of heart attack risk: This card displays the dataset's total aggregated risk level for heart attacks.
Stress Level Sum: This card displays the total aggregated stress level associated with heart attacks across the dataset.
sum of heart rate: This card displays the total aggregated heart rate associated with heart attacks in the dataset.

pie Chart:-

I designed a pie chart to show the total number of exercise hours per week per diet. Ensure that each slice of the pie chart is clearly identified with the food category and related exercise hours.

table:-

To show the patient ID by age, sex, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and total smoking, I made a table. The table offers a simple and well-organised method to access comprehensive information on cholesterol, blood pressure, and smoking by patient ID. Users may quickly identify each patient ID and check blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking using this table.

slicer:-

We check the country-specific heart attack report after I made a slicer to show the nation. For studying heart attack reports on a per-country basis, a slicer for nation selection is a helpful resource.

ribbon chart:-

I made a ribbon chart that shows the sum of heart attack risk and past cardiac problems by patient ID. You may quickly check which patient IDs have greater or lower values for heart attack risk and prior cardiac problems

stacked column chart:-

I made a stacked column chart to show the overall stress levels broken down by sex. Determine your stress levels based on sex with this chart.
